## Introduction

In this task you will be working on the same todo application that you built in previous week. But this time the main motive of the task is to make you familiar with **Rest APIs**

## Components of an Application

- A backend server that supplies the API endpoints to the frontend.
  [Back-End Web Architecture | Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/back-end-architecture)
  Endpoints are important aspects of interacting with server-side web APIs, as they specify where resources lie that can be accessed by third party software. Usually the access is via a URI to which HTTP requests are posted, and from which the response is thus expected.

- A server environment (we shall use node) and HTTPS server that listens to server ports and sends responses from the server back to the client (Also known as MiddleWare).

- The frontend code which would interact with the user.

**Why Separate backend and frontend code?**

For a better understanding of why backend and frontend should necessarily be well-separated, read the below article.

# APIs

So this week you are going to get started with using API endpoints. For basic knowledge of APIs, as to what basically is an API and what is it's purpose, take a look at the following video.

[What is an API?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7wmiS2mSXY)

For apps of all shapes and sizes (mobile app, web app, IoT, desktop app) they need a well-defined **Application Programming _Interface_ (API)** to abstract away the business logic of backend and to cater to any client supporting only HTTP.

Now that you know what an API actually is, the next stage is to learn how can we use APIs and what are the ways to interact with these APIs

Due to security concerns browsers implement a security policy called as CORS which can surely pop up as error many times. So it's important to understand what is CORS or Cross Origin Resource Sharing

[Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) - HTTP | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)

We'll cover the most popular pattern of HTTP APIs, the so-called RESTful APIs next week! However for a brief intro, here you go

So much for the conceptual part, let's get started with the practical knowledge!

# Bonus: Adding Animations

So to make your app look more attractive and appealing to usersâ€™ eyes we will like to introduce you all to animations in a flutter. Go through the official docs to get a good understanding of animations class in a flutter.
